# Monopoly counter by Alex Katyukov

This is the money counter for Monopoly game. It
can keep money amount for each player. Now the
project is on start of development, so it is
not workable yet. I sure delete this sentences
and add the link when project will be ready
for use :)

This project is web application that can be
started with any modern browser.

## Frequently asked

### What this counter will be able to do?

  a file weight of a couple of kB instead of
  adjusting the settings each time you want to
  play

  think it's needed

### Why are you doing this project

I am not found any app to count money in Monopoly
game for PC — all solutions was build for phones.
It was not convenient for me and my friends at
moment as we wanted to see scores in a monitor. I
quickly make some Excel spreadsheet for this, but
it's not perfect. So I decided to do this
counter.
